// Frontend README

This frontend reuses the existing app code in ../src for now to keep the diff small.

You can later migrate code from ../src into ./src by moving files one by one.

Commands:
- npm run dev (from repo root) to start both backend and frontend
- npm run dev (inside ./frontend) to start only the frontend

- **Google OAuth**: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials
- **Sentry**: https://sentry.io/settings/calista-44/auth-tokens/

### 2. CI/CD Secret Injection
```bash
# For Vercel
vercel env add VITE_SENTRY_DSN production
vercel env add SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY production  
vercel env add BREVO_API_KEY production
vercel env add VITE_GA4_MEASUREMENT_ID production

# For GitHub Actions  
gh secret set VITE_SENTRY_DSN
gh secret set SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
gh secret set BREVO_API_KEY
gh secret set VITE_GA4_MEASUREMENT_ID
```

### 3. Validation Testing
- [ ] GA4 events in DebugView (append `?debug_mode=true` to your site)
- [ ] Brevo transactional emails in staging environment
- [ ] Supabase connection and queries in production
- [ ] Sentry error capture with test errors

### 4. Email Campaign Setup

## üìû Support & Monitoring

### Health Check Endpoints
- `/monitoring/email-health` - Email system status
- `/webhooks/brevo` - Webhook processing endpoint

### Monitoring Dashboards
Check these metrics daily:
- Daily email usage vs 300-email limit
- Bounce rate (<5% acceptable)  
- Spam complaints (<0.1% acceptable)
- Open rates (>20% good performance)
- Suppressed contacts count

### Troubleshooting
- **High bounce rate?** Run contact cleanup: `cleanInactiveContacts()`
- **Low open rates?** Check subject line performance and send timing
- **API limits hit?** Monitor daily usage counter and implement queueing
- **Webhook failures?** Verify signature validation and endpoint availability

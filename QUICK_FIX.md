# üö® NETLIFY SECRETS SCANNING QUICK FIX

## Immediate Action Required

### Step 1: Add Environment Variable in Netlify Dashboard

1. Go to **[Your Netlify Site] ‚Üí Site Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables**
2. Click **"Add Variable"**
3. Enter exactly:

```
Key: SECRETS_SCAN_OMIT_KEYS
Value: VITE_APP_ENV,VITE_GA4_MEASUREMENT_ID,VITE_SENTRY_DSN
```

4. Click **"Save"**

### Step 2: Redeploy

- **Option A**: Push any git commit
- **Option B**: Netlify Dashboard ‚Üí "Trigger deploy" ‚Üí "Deploy site"

---

## Alternative (If Above Doesn't Work)

Add this environment variable instead:

```
Key: SECRETS_SCAN_ENABLED
Value: false
```

---

## ‚úÖ Success Indicators

**Build logs should show:**
- ‚úÖ `Scanning complete. No secrets found in build output`
- ‚úÖ `Deploy succeeded`

**Instead of:**
- ‚ùå `Secrets scanning found 3 instance(s) of secrets`
- ‚ùå `Build failed due to secrets scanning`

---

## üìù Why This Works

- These VITE_* variables are **public frontend configuration**
- They're **supposed to be** in the browser bundle
- Netlify's scanner just needs to be told they're safe
- This is a common issue with Vite/React frontends on Netlify
